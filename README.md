# Pokémon Red and Blue: Space World Edition

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Red and Blue. It has been modified by Rangi to use the Pokémon sprites from the Gold and Silver beta versions demoed at Nintendo Space World 1997, which were leaked in May 2018.

Credit goes to Pia Carrot and Copetin for the improved trainer back sprites of Red and the old man.

Furthermore, the default text speed is fast, and you can double your movement speed by holding B (like Running Shoes)—even when you're on the Bicycle.

It builds the following ROMs:

* pokered.gbc  `md5: 42a6921eec607d379070d6a41f385971`
* pokeblue.gbc `md5: db3addef215851a094ebd9cbf62c8edc`

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).

If you can't build the repository yourself, you can download these IPS patches and apply them to a clean ROM with a tool like [Lunar IPS](https://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/).
